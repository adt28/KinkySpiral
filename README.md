KinkySpiral - Python Turtle
By A.D.Tejpal - 25-Mar-2021

This is a Python-Turtle program demonstrating drawing of spirals made up of kinky spokes.

The user has the option to try out variations in density of spokes as well as their kink angle.

Fresh rounds of graded color animation keep taking place at short intervals.
